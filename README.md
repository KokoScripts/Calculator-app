# Calculator-app
_Calculator app project for "Functions with output" section of Angela Yu Python Course_
I am currently taking the Python 100 days of code with Angela Yu on Udemy.  
Day 10 focuses on a different flavor of Functions that uses outputs instead of inputs. At the end of the module, there's a calculator app project to practice the module.
This is the project.
